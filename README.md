# Plasmic example: authentication using next-auth

This is a demo of how you can connect Plasmic with [next-auth](https://authjs.dev) (recently renamed to auth.js) to implement authentication.

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, fill in the project ID and token.

2. Run `npx auth secret` to generate a secret for next-auth

3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies

4. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

5. Open your browser to see the result at http://localhost:3000
